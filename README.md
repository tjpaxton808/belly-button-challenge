# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset through an interactive dashboard. This project visualizes the microbial species, or operational taxonomic units (OTUs), found in human navels, showcasing the biodiversity present in human belly buttons.

## Project Overview

This dashboard visualizes data from the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which documents the microbes that inhabit human navels. It features dynamic charts that update based on the selected test subject. The user can interact with the data by selecting different test subjects to display varying microbial data represented through engaging visual elements.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu:** Allows users to select a test subject by ID and dynamically updates all visual elements accordingly.
- **Demographic Information Panel:** Displays selected subject's demographic data such as ethnicity, gender, age, and location.
- **Bar Chart:** Visualizes the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.
- **Bubble Chart:** Displays each microbe where the size of the bubble correlates to the prevalence of the microbe in the selected individual.

## Technologies

- **HTML/CSS:** Structure and styling of the webpage.
- **JavaScript:** Functional programming for data handling and DOM manipulation.
- **D3.js:** Powerful visualization library used to bind arbitrary data to the DOM and apply data-driven transformations to the document.
- **Plotly.js:** Used for creating interactive charts.
- **Bootstrap:** Framework for responsive and mobile-first sites.
